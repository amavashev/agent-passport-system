# Build the APS runtime WASM verifier (batched check_many surface).
#
# Stage 1 (always runs): compile the crate to wasm32-unknown-unknown.
#   This produces the raw module at
#   target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/aps_sdk_runtime_wasm.wasm
#   and is the build path verified on this host.
#
# Stage 2 (environment-gated): generate JS/TS bindings with
#   wasm-bindgen-cli. Skipped automatically when wasm-bindgen is not on
#   PATH. The JS-loadable bundle is therefore pending a runner that has
#   wasm-bindgen-cli installed; it is NOT faked here.
#
# This script never installs anything into the shared repo root. The
# wasm32 target is a rustup component; wasm-bindgen-cli, if used, is a
# per-developer tool outside the repo.
