/**
 * @fileoverview EXPERIMENTAL, ISOLATED. Types for BBS selective-disclosure
 * scope credentials. This package is NOT imported by core and is NOT
 * core-reviewed crypto this round.
 *
 * A scope credential binds an ordered list of scope strings (for example
 * delegation scopes such as "read:repo" or "settle:usd:<=100") into a single
 * fixed-size BBS signature. The holder can later derive a zero-knowledge proof
 * that reveals only a chosen SUBSET of those scopes, without revealing the
 * undisclosed scopes or the original signature.
 *
 * Local mirror of ScopeOfClaim. The shape mirrors
 * src/v2/accountability/types/base.ts so callers can dogfood the honest-scope
 * convention without this isolated package importing core. Kept structurally
 * compatible on purpose; it is intentionally a copy, not an import, to preserve
 * isolation.
