// Values Floor Policy — Three-Signature Chain
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Architecture from Agent Agora deliberation (px2-006):
//   1. ActionIntent — agent declares what it wants to do (signed)
//   2. PolicyDecision — evaluator checks against floor (signed)
//   3. ActionReceipt — executor proves what was done (signed)
//
// Three signatures. Full audit trail. Every step cryptographically
// provable. The floor becomes not just "did you read it" but
// "here's proof of what was checked."
