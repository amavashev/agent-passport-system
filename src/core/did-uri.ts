// DID URI helpers for rail receipts (Phase 4.1 / P12)
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Receipts historically carried `signer_did = <raw hex Ed25519 pubkey>`.
// That binds receipt verification to a specific key forever — rotation
// gives no security benefit because the verifier cannot tell whether
// the embedded pubkey is currently retired in the issuer's DID document.
//
// Phase 4.1 / P12 switches signer_did to a DID URI of the form
// `did:<method>:<id>#<keyRef>` (e.g. `did:aps:zABC#key-2`). The verifier
// resolves the DID document via a caller-supplied resolver, walks
// verificationMethod[] to find the matching key, and respects retiredAt:
//
//   - Key not in doc                                → reject
//   - Key retired BEFORE the receipt was signed     → reject (compromise)
//   - Key retired AFTER the receipt was signed      → accept (legitimate
//                                                     post-rotation
//                                                     verification)
//   - Key currently active                          → accept
//
// Receipts continue to carry raw hex pubkeys when issuers don't supply
// agentId/keyRef inputs — that is the legacy compatible-superset path.
