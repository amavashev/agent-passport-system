// Remote Signer adapters - public surface (W2-B2, EXTENDS)
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// A pluggable async Signer abstraction over the existing Ed25519 default. The
// default function `sign(message, privateKeyHex)` in src/crypto/keys.ts and its
// ~40 callsites are UNCHANGED. The abstraction is opt-in.
//
//   Signer                  the interface (sign / publicKeyHex / keyId / handle)
//   LocalEd25519Signer      default, delegates to the unchanged sign()
//   HandleSigner            remote reference: two backend callbacks + a handle,
//                           holds NO raw key (the cloud-SDK-free shape every
//                           remote adapter reduces to)
//   verifyWithSigner        verify a signer signature via the unchanged verify()
//
// Cloud adapters (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Vault Transit, PKCS#11) live in the
// isolated optional package packages/aps-remote-signer with their own
// package.json and are NEVER imported here, so core ships no cloud SDK.
//
// PROOF BOX (dogfooded as a ScopeOfClaim via buildRemoteSignerScopeOfClaim):
//   Proves:        a remote-signer receipt carries the SAME signature relation
//                  as the local-signer path (same UTF-8 message bytes, same raw
//                  64-byte Ed25519 signature, verifies under the unchanged
//                  verify()), and the signing key stayed in the HSM/KMS (only a
//                  handle and the returned signature ever crossed into process).
//   Does NOT prove: that the KMS/HSM itself is uncompromised, that the operator
//                  custody policy on the key is correct, or anything about key
//                  provenance beyond the public key the verifier trusts.
