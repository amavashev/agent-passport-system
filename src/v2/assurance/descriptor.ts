// Evidence Descriptor - a verifier OUTPUT over a receipt's evidence
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// THE HEADLINE: assurance is a verifier-derived OUTPUT, never an
// issuer-set INPUT. There is no issuer-written assurance field anywhere in
// this module. Nothing here is read from a receipt's body as a grade. The
// descriptor reports MECHANICAL FACTS the verifier can recompute from the
// receipt, the signatures, and the key/DID graph:
//
//   - the signer set and which DID signed which claim;
//   - the observationBasis of each witness;
//   - the presence of any WitnessConflict;
//   - multi-party signature validity, GENERALIZED from
//     verifyBilateralReceipt (not a new multi-signature checker);
//   - signer independence, derived from the key and DID graph via the
//     sharesRoot relation (two signers chaining to the same root are NOT
//     independent - witnesses sharing the gateway root of trust are still
//     self-attestation).
//
// LATTICE, NOT LADDER. The corroboration status is the four-valued Belnap
// ConstraintStatus (pass | fail | not_applicable | unknown), the same
// vocabulary the gateway constraint engine uses. It is not a 1..5 score.
//
// ONE advisory scalar sits on top, computed by the verifier FROM the
// descriptor and labelled a relying-party-policy output. It is never read
// from the receipt and never claims truth. A relying party may ignore it,
// recompute it, or replace it with its own policy.
