// sharesRoot - signer independence from the key and DID graph
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Independence is the SHARP metric for an evidence descriptor. Two signers
// that share a confidence backbone are not independent witnesses, no matter
// how many distinct keys or DIDs they present. Witnesses that chain to the
// same gateway root of trust are still self-attestation.
//
// This file derives that relation MECHANICALLY from a graph the verifier
// already holds: each signer is a node identified by its public key or DID,
// and `chainsTo` edges name the anchors (issuer DID, gateway root, JWKS
// origin, trust-anchor fingerprint) it depends on. Two signers `sharesRoot`
// when their anchor closures intersect. Nothing here reads an issuer-written
// field; nothing grades or scores. It answers one yes/no question per pair:
// do these two signers reduce to a common root?
//
// The relation is reflexive (a signer always shares a root with itself),
// symmetric (order does not matter), and computed over the transitive
// closure of `chainsTo` so an indirect common ancestor still collapses
// independence. It is NOT transitive across signers: A and B sharing a
// root, and B and C sharing a DIFFERENT root, does not make A and C share
// a root. Independence is a per-pair fact, not a partition.

/**
 * One signer as a node in the key and DID graph. A signer is whatever
 * produced a signature the verifier checked: an agent, a gateway, a
 * notary, an external anchor. `id` is its stable identity (public key hex
 * or DID). `chainsTo` lists the roots/anchors it directly depends on:
 * issuer DID, gateway root-of-trust fingerprint, JWKS origin, trust-anchor
 * key id. These are the edges the independence relation closes over.
 *
 * This is a verifier-side projection of facts already on the receipt and
 * in resolution results (e.g. a KeyResolution's selected kid / JWKS
 * origin). It carries no assurance level and no issuer claim.
