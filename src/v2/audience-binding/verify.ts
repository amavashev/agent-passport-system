 * @fileoverview Audience-binding verification primitives.
 *
 * ── PROOF BOX ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * What a passing audience check PROVES:
 *   The issuer named this relying party (by its `recipientId`) among the
 *   intended recipients of the proof. A proof minted for recipient A is
 *   rejected when checked against recipient B.
 *
 * What it does NOT prove:
 *   - It does NOT prove the proof is otherwise valid. Audience is one facet;
 *     the signature, freshness, scope, and revocation checks are separate and
 *     must all pass independently.
 *   - It does NOT prevent a NAMED recipient from misusing what it legitimately
 *     received. Audience binding restricts WHO may present a proof, not what a
 *     legitimate holder does with it afterward.
 *   - It is NOT an assurance scalar. The status is a mechanical fact about
 *     recipient-identifier membership, derived by the verifier from its own
 *     policy, never read from the proof.
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The membership algorithm reuses the array-normalize + `includes` pattern
 * already established by jwtSvidToDidInput in src/adapters/oauth-rfc8693, and
 * the `expectedAudience`/`recipientId` naming so request-level and proof-level
 * audience reads consistently across the SDK.
