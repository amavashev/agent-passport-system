/**
 * @fileoverview Reconcile audience binding with the existing cross_chain
 * confused-deputy constraint.
 *
 * Audience binding and cross_chain are complementary, not competing:
 *
 *   - cross_chain (src/types/cross-chain.ts, FACET 'cross_chain') stops
 *     authority from principal X being COMBINED into a destination governed by
 *     principal Y unless a CrossChainPermit authorizes it. It is a DATA-FLOW
 *     restriction evaluated over a taint set.
 *
 *   - audience (FACET 'audience') stops a proof minted for recipient A from
 *     being PRESENTED to recipient B. It is a PROOF-PRESENTATION restriction
 *     evaluated over a recipient-identifier set.
 *
 * A single attempted misuse can trip both: presenting A's proof at B (audience
 * mismatch) while also crossing a data-flow boundary (cross_chain block). The
 * reconciliation rule below makes sure the relying party emits ONE primary
 * denial, not two contradictory ones, and never a contradiction (one facet
 * 'pass' while the other 'fail' for the SAME recipient mismatch).
 *
 * This module emits denials in the canonical ConstraintFailure shape
 * (src/types/gateway.ts) using the 'audience' facet. It does NOT invent a
 * parallel error type and does NOT re-implement cross_chain evaluation; it
 * consumes a cross_chain result the caller already computed.
