/**
 * @fileoverview Audience-binding types: a versioned, additive `aud` profile for
 * delegation and receipt proofs.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A passport (delegation or receipt) issued for recipient A must be rejected
 * when presented to recipient B. The `aud` field names the intended
 * recipient(s); a verifier holding its own recipient identity checks
 * membership. This is the proof-object analogue of the OAuth `aud` claim
 * (RFC 7519 §4.1.3 / RFC 8693 token exchange) and reuses the same
 * array-normalize + membership-check algorithm already in
 * src/adapters/oauth-rfc8693.
 *
 * ── WHY VERSIONED AND ADDITIVE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The `aud` slot is OPTIONAL on the proof object. A proof that OMITS it signs
 * and serializes byte-for-byte as it did before this module existed; nothing
 * about an audience-free proof changes. The slot is only "required" relative
 * to a verifier POLICY (`requireAudience`) or to a named PROFILE; it is never
 * issuer-asserted assurance. Audience binding is a mechanical fact (which
 * recipient identifier the issuer named), not a verifier-derived assurance
 * scalar.
 *
 * ── RELATION TO cross_chain ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * cross_chain (src/types/cross-chain.ts) prevents the confused-deputy problem
 * at the DATA-FLOW layer: it stops authority from principal X being combined
 * with a destination governed by principal Y unless a CrossChainPermit
 * authorizes it. Audience binding operates at the PROOF-PRESENTATION layer: it
 * stops a proof minted for recipient A from being replayed at recipient B.
 * They are complementary, not competing. `reconcileAudienceWithCrossChain`
 * (see reconcile.ts) keeps a single denial from being counted twice.
 */

/**
 * The audience descriptor carried additively on a proof. A proof object gains
 * a single optional `aud` field of this shape. When absent, the proof is
 * audience-unbound and serializes exactly as before.
 *
 * `recipients` is the set of recipient identifiers the proof was issued for.
 * An identifier is an opaque string the relying parties agree on out of band
 * (a DID, a public key hex, a service URL, a logical recipient name). This
 * module does not interpret the identifier; it only checks membership.
