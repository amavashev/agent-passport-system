/**
 * @fileoverview Compose audience binding with the M1 RFC 9421 request-binding
 * profile WITHOUT changing the signed bytes of the HTTP Message Signature.
 *
 * The request-binding profile already covers @authority in its signed base
 * (signature-base.ts: deriveAuthority). @authority IS the request-host
 * audience: a signature whose base names host A cannot be lifted onto a request
 * to host B, because reconstructing the base over host B yields a different
 * string and the signature check fails. This module does NOT redefine
 * @authority and does NOT add a new covered component (which would bump the
 * profile version and change bytes). Instead it offers a VERIFIER-SIDE policy
 * overlay: a relying party that knows the expected request host can assert it
 * explicitly and get a precise audience-style result, composed with the
 * existing verifyRequest pipeline.
 *
 * This keeps audience binding additive and optional-until-profile-required:
 *   - A caller that does not set expectedAuthority gets the unchanged
 *     verifyRequest behavior.
 *   - A caller that sets it gets an extra, precisely-labeled check that runs
 *     AFTER the cryptographic verification (so a forged base can never satisfy
 *     it) and never consumes the nonce on its own.
