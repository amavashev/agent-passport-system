// W2-B3. Revocation enforcement - type surface (additive, optional)
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// These types sit on top of the M4 verifier-hardening recorder
// (src/v2/verifier-hardening/index.ts). M4 records WHAT a revocation
// source reported (a RevocationFreshnessRecord). This module decides
// what a relying party DOES with that record, under a stated policy.
//
// Layer boundary: the SDK ships the policy shape, the ephemeral-token
// FORMAT, the refresh check, and the SET emission HOOK. Distribution
// (Bloom filters, push channels, transparency logs) is the gateway's
// job and is out of scope here. See the proof box in ./index.ts.
//
// Claims language: these primitives are "specified / tested / validated",
// never "proved / guaranteed". A freshness-policy decision applies the
// configured rule to the recorded staleness; it does not assert the
// revocation source was globally current beyond that recorded staleness.

/** How a relying party reacts to a revocation source that is stale or
 *  unreachable at verification time.
 *   - 'fail_open':         proceed even when the source is stale/unavailable
 *                          (availability over safety; the weakest posture).
 *   - 'fail_closed':       deny when the source is anything but 'fresh'
 *                          (safety over availability; the strictest posture).
 *   - 'bounded_staleness': accept while the recorded age is within an
 *                          explicit window, deny once it is past the window.
 *
 *  These three names extend the core RevocationCheckPolicy
 *  ('fail_open' | 'fail_closed' | 'cache_grace') in src/core/delegation.ts:
 *  'bounded_staleness' is the windowed analogue of 'cache_grace', expressed
 *  against the M4 RevocationFreshnessRecord rather than a cached boolean. */

 *   - 'downgrade':       proceed but mark the decision for downstream policy
 *                        (a relying-party-policy advisory, never an issuer
