// Hash-and-Pointer Payloads + Field-Disclosure Profile - Implementation
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// ============================ PROOF BOX ============================
// Specified, tested, validated.
//
// PROVES: A field-disclosure profile commits a receipt to a payload by hash
//   plus a pointer (URI) without embedding the raw payload, and binds each
//   field by hash so that a redacted or hidden field still leaves the receipt
//   signature verifiable. The builder rejects a raw value for any field marked
//   sensitive, so raw PII cannot reach the signed body through a 'public'
//   policy.
//
// DOES NOT PROVE:
//   - That the payload at the URI is available or unchanged. That requires
//     resolving the URI and re-hashing (compose the resolver, W2-A2). A
//     present URI is not an availability claim.
//   - That a hidden field's value is narrow or harmless. A hash binding hides
//     the value; it says nothing about what the value is.
//   - That an 'encrypted' field is actually encrypted, or with what key. This
//     module never encrypts; it carries caller-supplied ciphertext opaquely.
//   - Any truth about the field values themselves. A binding is a commitment to
//     a value, not a statement that the value is true.
// ==================================================================
//
// This file is solver-free, service-free, and does not fetch any URI.

 *     does, the build is rejected. This is the guard against raw PII reaching
 *     the signed body.
 *   - For 'hash_only' and 'redacted', only the hash binding is kept; the value
 *     is absent ('redacted' additionally records the '[REDACTED]' sentinel as
 *     the visible placeholder, matching the storage tombstone convention).
 *   - For 'encrypted', the caller-supplied ciphertext is kept; the value is
 *     absent. A missing ciphertext for an 'encrypted' field is rejected.
 *   - Every field carries a hash binding regardless of policy, so a hidden or
 *     redacted field still leaves the signature verifiable.
 *

 * it with the supplied URI.
