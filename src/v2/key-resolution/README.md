# Key Resolution (M3)

A standardized `KeyResolver` interface plus a reference resolver that maps a
DID (`did:key`, `did:web`, `did:cycles`) or a direct JWKS endpoint to a single
Ed25519 verification key. The returned key is a 64-char hex string the existing
`crypto/keys.ts` `verify()` consumes, so a Cycles envelope signature check can
run end to end.

This is an SDK protocol primitive: an interface and a reference implementation.
It is **not** a hosted resolution service. There is no cross-tenant aggregation,
no registry, no alerting, and no network endpoint exposed by this module.

## What it does

- **`KeyResolver` interface**: `canResolve(locator)` and `resolve(locator)`.
  A resolver answers "which public key does this locator assert?" and performs
  no signature verification itself.
- **`CyclesKeyResolver`**: one reference resolver behind that interface:
  - `did:key`: self-certifying, no network (reuses existing `fromDIDKey`).
  - `did:web`: fetches the DID Document (reuses existing `resolveDIDWeb`),
    selects a `verificationMethod` by fragment.
  - `did:cycles` / direct `jwksUrl`: fetches a JWKS (RFC 7517), selects an
    Ed25519 key (RFC 8037) by `kid`.
- **Caching**: in-process TTL cache with distinct hit/miss handling. A cached
  miss is never promoted to a key.
- **Failure policy**: explicit `fail-open` vs `fail-closed`, defaulting to
  `fail-closed`.

## did:cycles method shape

`did:cycles` is an AEOESS-defined, `did:web`-style, HTTPS-anchored method. It
mirrors `didWebToUrl` exactly, except the resolved document is a JWKS:

```
did:cycles:example.com          -> https://example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
did:cycles:example.com:agents:7 -> https://example.com/agents/7/jwks.json
did:cycles:example.com%3A8443   -> https://example.com:8443/.well-known/jwks.json
```

A DID-URL fragment is the `kid`: `did:cycles:example.com#agent-7-2026` selects
the JWK whose `kid === "agent-7-2026"`. With no fragment and exactly one signing
key, that key is used; with more than one and no `kid`, resolution fails closed
(ambiguous).

## Key selection

1. Resolve to a JWKS; assert `keys` is a non-empty array.
2. Filter to Ed25519 signing candidates: `kty==="OKP" && crv==="Ed25519"`,
   `use` absent or `"sig"`, `alg` absent or `"EdDSA"`, `key_ops` absent or
   includes `"verify"`.
3. With a requested `kid`: exactly one candidate must match (exact,
   case-sensitive). Zero matches fails closed (unknown key); duplicate `kid`
   fails closed (ambiguous).
4. With no `kid`: exactly one candidate is used; otherwise fails closed.
5. Decode `x` base64url to exactly 32 bytes; that is the Ed25519 public key.

A private JWK `d` member is a misconfiguration and is never used.

## Security posture: fail-closed by default

Any unreachable endpoint, network error, timeout, non-200 HTTP, non-JSON body,
malformed JWKS, missing or extra `keys`, unknown or duplicate `kid`, unsupported
`kty`/`crv`, or `x` that does not decode to 32 bytes yields **no key**, and the
signature check rejects. "Could not fetch the key" is never "signature valid".

`fail-open` is an explicit, opt-in, documented-degraded mode. It relaxes **only**
the unreachable/transient-network case into a degraded result that carries **no
key material** and is flagged `degraded: true`. A JWKS that loads but is
malformed, or a requested `kid` that is absent, still fails closed. HTTPS only;
off-host redirects are not followed.

## Proof box

> **Proves:** Resolving a key shows which public key a DID or JWKS endpoint
> asserts for that locator **at resolution time**.
>
> **Does not prove:** that the key is uncompromised or under sole control of the
> named party; that the endpoint asserts the same key at any later time; or that
> any signature made with the key is authorized. Under `fail-open`, an
> unreachable endpoint yields a degraded result that carries no key material and
> must not be read as a positive verification.

## Spec sources

- JWK Set + `kid`/`use`/`alg`: RFC 7517.
- OKP/Ed25519 JWK (`kty`/`crv`/`x`, EdDSA): RFC 8037.
- Ed25519 algorithm + Test 1 vector: RFC 8032 §7.1.
- DID-to-HTTPS mapping pattern mirrored from: did:web.
- base64url: RFC 7515 §2 / RFC 4648 §5.
- `did:cycles`: no external spec exists; AEOESS-defined here.
