/**
 * Types for the signed, content-addressed policy-bundle primitive.
 *
 * A policy-bundle is three things together:
 *   1. a deterministic tar of policy files,
 *   2. a JCS-canonical manifest that pins each file by sha256 and pins the
 *      whole tar by sha256, plus governance changeType metadata,
 *   3. an Ed25519 detached signature over the canonical manifest.
 *
 * The format reuses existing protocol primitives: JCS canonicalization
 * (src/core/canonical-jcs.ts), the changeType governance vocabulary
 * (src/types/governance.ts), aps.txt for revocation (src/core/aps-txt.ts),
 * and ScopeOfClaim for honest scope declaration (accountability/types/base).
