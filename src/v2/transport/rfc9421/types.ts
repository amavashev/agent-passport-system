/**
 * @fileoverview Type definitions for the RFC 9421 + RFC 9530 request-binding
 * profile.
 *
 * This profile wraps a request-bound HTTP Message Signature (RFC 9421) as the
 * INNER proof and links it to an APS delegation receipt by content hash. The
 * HTTP signature shows "this exact request was the one authorized"; the APS
 * layer shows authority. These are two separate claims and must not be
 * conflated.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: action_ref does NOT bind the HTTP request. The binding between an
 * HTTP request and a delegation receipt here is the inner HTTP Message
 * Signature plus the explicit receipt content hash carried in the profile, not
 * the action_ref preimage.
 *
 * Strings below follow RFC 9421 (HTTP Message Signatures) and RFC 9530 (Digest
 * Fields) byte conventions. Byte-exactness is load-bearing: any difference in
 * case, the ": " separator, LF vs CRLF, parameter order, quoting, or
 * Structured-Fields serialization between the @signature-params base line and
 * the Signature-Input field value will cause verification failure.
 */
