// Receipt context-layer verification (shippable)
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// The crypto layer (verifyActionReceipt) answers "is this receipt a
// well-formed, correctly-signed, un-tampered aps:action:v1 receipt".
// That is necessary but not sufficient. A cryptographically sound
// receipt can still be presented OUTSIDE the envelope it was issued
// for: against an expired or revoked delegation, over budget, by the
// wrong principal, under a stale policy, replayed, or as proof of a
// claim it never made. Those are CONTEXT rejections.
//
// None of the context inputs live inside the signed bytes. They are
// the relying party's own ground truth (its revocation view, its
// budget ceiling, the principal it expects to be accountable, the
// receipt_ids it has already honored). A conformant verifier MUST
// apply both layers.
//
// This module was promoted from the conformance generator so the
// offline verifier and the relying-party middleware can consume it as
// shippable API. The reason taxonomy and the check ORDER are pinned:
// the golden negative fixtures assert WHY each rejection happens, so a
// reorder or rename would break the conformance corpus. Extend by
// adding new reasons at the end, never by reordering existing checks.
//
// SCOPE OF CLAIM (dogfooded):
//   Proves: a receipt that passes both layers is a well-formed,
//     correctly-signed receipt presented inside the envelope the
//     relying party's supplied context describes.
//   Does NOT prove: that the off-protocol side effect the receipt
//     names actually happened, that the signer's key was honestly
//     held, or that the relying party's context is itself accurate. A
//     receipt is a signed declaration, not a causal proof.
