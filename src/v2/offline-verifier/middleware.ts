// Relying-party middleware core - framework-agnostic
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// A reference relying-party gate: it verifies an agent's passport and its
// scope, and DROPS unauthorized traffic before any application logic runs.
//
// This module is framework-agnostic on purpose. The decision logic lives
// in a single pure function, evaluateRequest, which takes the presented
// passport and the required scope and returns an admit/deny decision. The
// Express and Fastify adapters (examples/aps-relying-party-middleware) are
// thin shells that extract the passport from the request, call this
// function, and either call next() or send the deny response. Keeping the
// core here means the gate is tested in the main suite with no web
// framework installed, and an integrator can wire it into any server.
//
// Reuse: the passport signature/expiry check is the existing
// verifyPassport (src/verification/verify.ts), with its established
// { trustedIssuers, clock } options surface. The scope check reads the
// passport's capabilities[] (the existing capability vocabulary). Nothing
// new is invented for identity or expiry.
//
// PUBLIC/PRIVATE boundary: this is the SLOT and the HOOK, not a service.
// It does not ship identity bridges, policy-template libraries,
// dashboards, rate limiting, or session stores. It admits or denies one
// request against a presented passport. An integrator supplies the
// trust anchors, the required scope, and the transport binding.
//
// SCOPE OF CLAIM (dogfooded language, no receipt here so no ScopeOfClaim
// object): this gate decides admission from a passport's signature,
// validity window, and declared capabilities. It is SPECIFIED and TESTED
// to drop a request whose passport fails to verify or lacks the required
// scope. It does NOT prove the agent will behave within scope after
// admission, only that the presented credential authorizes the request at
// the gate.
