/**
 * Responsibility cascade for v2 delegation chains.
 *
 * Substrate for matrix v2 candidate C-II-3 (recursive delegation
 * accountability beyond two hops). Monotonic narrowing in v1 answers who
 * authorizes what at each transfer. It does not answer which human or
 * organization bears responsibility when chains from several principals
 * converge at hop three or later (the gap named in arxiv 2604.23280v1).
 *
 * The v0.1 cascade resolves a chain to one or more root principals. Mixed
 * chains return all distinct roots, jointly attributed. The divergence from
 * naive monotonic narrowing is intentional: a single most-recent principal
 * is not enough when several principals authorized parallel paths.
 *
 * v0.2 work (out of scope here): smart reputation weighting, cross-protocol
 * cascade, revocation cascade, UI affordances.

/**
 * Resolve the principal of record for an action taken under the leaf of a
 * delegation chain.
 *
 * Rules (v0.1):
 *
 * 1. Direct anchor. For every hop with a responsibility_anchor of kind
 *    'human' or 'org', the principal_id is recorded as a root principal.
 * 2. Indirect anchor. For every hop with a responsibility_anchor of kind
 *    'agent_acting_for_principal', walk acting_agent_id through the chain
 *    until a 'human' or 'org' anchor is reached. Record that principal.
 *    If the walk revisits a principal it has already seen, the chain is
 *    circular. If the walk exits without reaching a human or org, the chain
 *    is missing its root anchor.
 * 3. Joint attribution. If several distinct root principals are reachable
 *    from the chain, all are returned. This is the divergence from naive
 *    monotonic narrowing required by C-II-3.
 * 4. Legacy fallback. If no anchor is present on any hop, the chain root's
 *    delegator is synthesized as a 'human' principal. This preserves
 *    pre-anchor behavior for chains issued before this SDK version.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *
 * - Returned principals are unique by principal_id (first kind wins on
 *   duplicate principal_id with mixed kinds).
 * - chain_integrity is 'ok' only when at least one principal was resolved
 *   and no cycle was observed during indirect walks.
 * - An empty chain returns no principals and chain_integrity
 *   'missing_root_anchor'.
 * - The function is pure: no store reads, no signature verification, no
 *   side effects. Pair with validateV2Delegation and
 *   validateChainComposition before relying on the result.
