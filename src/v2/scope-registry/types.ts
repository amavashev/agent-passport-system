// Scope Dimension Registry. Types.
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A delegation scope is a product of dimensions (time, spend, scope,
// data_class, destination, purpose, ...). Each dimension declares:
//   - its type (what kind of value it ranges over),
//   - whether it is decidable (a mechanical predicate settles it), and
//   - its enforcement_strength: 'strict' or 'advisory'.
//
// Strict decidable dimensions are routed into the M6 feasibility partial
// order check (src/v2/feasibility): they become part of the hard
// obligation. Advisory dimensions (free-text purpose, self-declared
// intent) are REMOVED from the hard check and carried as honest-scope
// 'does_not_assert' lines. An advisory dimension can never be the basis
// of a hard deny.
//
// This registry classifies and describes dimensions. It does not decide
// the obligation: deciding is the solver's job, downstream of M6.
