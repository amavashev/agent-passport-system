// Human-oversight descriptor (verifier-derived)
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// The descriptor is the verifier OUTPUT computed over the human-oversight
// slots. It is a SET of mechanical facts consistent with the four-valued
// Belnap ConstraintStatus (src/types/gateway.ts), never a scalar ladder
// and never read from the receipt. It records:
//   - which co-signer signatures over the body checked out (per signer),
//   - whether a human oversight signature is present and valid,
//   - which signers are independent in the key and DID graph (the sharp
//     metric: signers that share a root of trust are NOT independent),
//   - whether an approval reference is recorded and which scheme it uses,
//   - whether a break_glass declaration is present, well formed, in force,
//     and over an allowed class.
//
// At most ONE verifier-derived advisory scalar sits on top of the set:
// `advisory_independent_human_oversight`. It is labeled a relying-party
// -policy output, computed here, and is NEVER an issuer-set field on any
// receipt. Relying parties MAY ignore it and read the set directly.
