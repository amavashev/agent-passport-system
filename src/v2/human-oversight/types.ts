// Human oversight as evidence (W2-B5): slot + descriptor type shapes
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Additive, optional, versioned slots that record human oversight on a
// general (NON-bilateral) signed receipt as evidence, plus the shapes a
// verifier derives from them. The slots carry mechanical facts only:
// which DID signed which body, the recorded approval reference, and the
// break_glass declaration. Nothing here is an issuer-set assurance
// value. Assurance is computed by the verifier as a relying-party-policy
// output (see descriptor.ts), never read from the receipt.
//
// For the BILATERAL case (two interacting agents co-sign one outcome)
// use the existing src/core/bilateral-receipt.ts co-sign. These slots
// cover the general path: a human and an agent (or a gateway) co-signing
// one canonical body that is NOT a bilateral interaction outcome.

// ── Co-signer role ──
// The party class a co-signature represents. 'human' is the oversight
// signature this module exists to record; 'agent' and 'gateway' let a
// general body carry the same destructure-then-canonicalize multi-sig
// discipline as a bilateral receipt without being a bilateral receipt.
export type CoSignerRole = 'human' | 'agent' | 'gateway'

// ── Co-signer entry ──
// One signature over the SAME canonical body as every sibling entry.
// Modeled on ApprovalSignature (src/types/approval.ts) so a co_signer
// slot and a charter ApprovalSignature stay structurally aligned. The
// signed bytes are canonicalize(receipt-minus-the-co_signer-slot), the
// same discipline as bilateral-receipt.ts:101-102.

// A pointer to an approval request that lives outside this receipt.
// Matches the two existing request-id schemes: 'approval-<hex>'
// (commerce.ts:221) or 'approval_<uuid12>' (charter.ts:542). No third
// scheme is coined. Optionally binds the signed approval by hash via the

// ── Break-glass declaration ──
// A FORMAT recording that an emergency override was declared, who
// declared it, when it expires, and whether a post-hoc review is owed.
// This is not machinery: no workflow runs here, no notification fires,
// no escalation executes. Those are gateway operations and out of scope.

// (src/v2/key-resolution), reused by the caller, not re-implemented here.

// Verifier-supplied predicate: do two signers share a root of trust in
// the key and DID graph? Two signers that share the gateway root are
// still self-attestation; independence is derived from this relation,
// not asserted by the issuer. Returns true when the two signers are NOT
// independent (they share a root). The caller computes this from the key
// and DID graph (M3 resolution, trust anchors); this module consumes it.
