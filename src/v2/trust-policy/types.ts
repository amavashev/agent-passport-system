// Trust Root Policy (W2-B1): types
// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// A trust-root-policy is a signed, versioned artifact a relying party
// carries to decide which issuers/keys it accepts for a receipt, how
// keys resolve, how rotation is tolerated, and what to do when an
// endpoint is stale or offline. It composes the existing surfaces and
// adds NO issuer-written assurance: a verdict is a verifier-derived
// OUTPUT computed against THIS policy, never a field read off a receipt.
//
// Reuse map (do not duplicate):
//   - TrustAnchor / TrustAnchorBundle / verifyBundle / checkAnchor from
//     v2/mutual-auth (local trust-anchor resolution; root-signed bundle).
//   - KeyResolver / KeyLocator / KeyResolution / FailurePolicy from
//     v2/key-resolution (M3): how a pinned/declared key is fetched.
//   - canonicalizeJCS + crypto/keys sign/verify (sign-over-canonical
//     with the signature field omitted), the universal APS pattern.
//   - ScopeOfClaim from v2/accountability/types/base.
//
// SECURITY POSTURE (inherited from M3): fail-closed by default. An
// endpoint that could not be reached is NEVER "key valid". Offline and
// stale behaviors are EXPLICIT, opt-in, and surfaced in the verdict.
